<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Spark Plug Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Hot Spark Plugs</li><li>Cold Spark Plugs</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The spark plug market is primarily divided into two types: hot spark plugs and cold spark plugs. Hot spark plugs have a longer insulator nose that retains heat, making them suitable for engines that operate at lower temperatures. They enhance ignition in such environments. In contrast, cold spark plugs have a shorter insulator nose, dissipating heat quickly, which is ideal for high-performance or high-compression engines that operate at elevated temperatures. The choice between them impacts engine performance and longevity.</p></p>
